        Before you begin working through the notebooks, you will need to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python
            3
        </a>
        as well as the following dependencies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>numpy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>matplotlib</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>scipy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>jupyter</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>pandas</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To install these, or check that they are installed, please run the command:
    </p>
    <pre>python3 -m pip install scipy numpy matplotlib jupyter pandas</pre>
    <p>
        In a terminal. This should return a "Succesfully installed" message. Now in the terminal, navigate to this folder and run
        the command:
    </p>
    <pre>jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 9000</pre>
    <p>
        The terminal should then output the following: 
    </p>
    <pre>Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
        to login with a token:
            http://localhost:9000/?token=&ltauth token&gt</pre>
    <p id="bottom_p">
        Where &ltauth token&gt is your unique hexidecimal auth token. You will need to enter this when prompted 
        upon opening your first notebook. Leave this terminal running until you are done viewing the notebooks. When opening a 
        notebook, please run the code cell above the heading before continuing with the notebook. You do 
        not need to worry about the contents of this
        cell, only that it is for setting the format of the notebook, as well as importing the necessary functions. Make
        sure to run the cells sequentially when working through the notebooks, even if the code is hidden, as variables used in one cell may be initiated
        in a previous cell. You are now ready to begin reading the notebooks.
