    "In [classification](../classification/classification-intro.ipynb) we looked at different approaches for classifying a set of datapoints as one of mutiple classes each. In several classification applications such as image classification, the number of inputs per datapoint can be very large. For example, the images in the MNIST handwritten digits database are $28 \\times 28$ pixel images, living in a $784$-dimensional space of pixel intensities. However, the MNIST images do not populate the whole space homogeneously but rather occupy a smaller subspace: although there is variability within the dataset due to different handwritings, slightly rotated or translated characters and so on, the characters of a given class $(0, 1, 2 ..., 9)$ are somewhat similar to each other:"

For example, we could drop the direction perpendicular to the black arrow in the dataset above and still retain enough information to fit a simpler model to the now $1$D dataset. This is an example of data pre-processing to simplify model fitting.\n",
